# Fantastical Magiks (update)
 Stellaris mod updated to work on recent versions of the game

initial version
- Mostly all of the code has been ported to work with latest version (3.5.*)
- Fixed a few issues that cause error.log bloat
- Above fixes require more work since most of them are dummy fillers (based on base game)
- Due to difference in game mechanics, some of the features will play out differently
